# 05-work-day-scheduler

## Task

In this project, I was tasked to write a work day scheduler with the following features:
- When the page is load initially, the current day should appear at the top.
- The user will be presented with time blocks, each corresponding to an hour of standard working day.
- Each time block will be colour coded to represent past, present and future.
- The user can write enter event/s/tasks on each time block.
- These can be saved by clicking on the button to the right.
- These will be saved in local storage, so that they can load on reloading the page.


### Preview

The end product should resemble the mock-up provided below:

> **Note:** This layout will not look as good when the resolution drops below 768px.
